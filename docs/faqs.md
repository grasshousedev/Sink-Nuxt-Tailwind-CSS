## 2. Why can't I log in?

Please check if `NUXT_SITE_TOKEN` is set to pure numbers, Sink does not support pure number Tokens, we consider this to be unsafe.

## 3. Why can't I see the analytics data?

Analytics data needs to read Cloudflare's data, check if `NUXT_CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `NUXT_CF_API_TOKEN` are correctly configured. Pay attention to the account id deployment zone id, whether the Worker analytics engine is turned on.

Of course. Please set the environment variable `NUXT_HOME_URL` to your blog or official website address.

## 5. Why can't I see the statistics after deploying with NuxtHub?

NuxtHub's ANALYTICS points to its dataset, you need to set the `NUXT_DATASET` environment variable to point to the same dataset.
